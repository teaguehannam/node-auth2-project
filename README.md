## Assignment

	Use Node.js, Express and Knex to build an API that provides
	_Authentication_ functionality using SQLite to store _User_ information.

	The user schema should include: `username`, `password` and `department`. 
	The `department` should be a string used to group the users. 
	No need for a `departments` table or setting up relationships.

	Use **JSON Web Tokens** to keep users authenticated across requests.


### Design and build the following endpoints.

	POST - /api/register
		Creates a `user` using the information sent inside the `body` of the request. 
		**Hash the password** before saving the user to the database. 

	POST - /api/login
		Use the credentials sent inside the `body` to authenticate the user. 
		On successful login, create a new JWT with the user id as the subject and send it back to the client. 
		If login fails, respond with the correct status code and the message: 'You shall not pass!'

	GET - /api/users
		If the user is logged in, respond with an array of all the users contained in the database. 
		If the user is not logged in respond with the correct status code and the message: 'You shall not pass!'.
